ElytrAI is a project created for the project course CS-175 that aims to create an agent capable of learning to fly an elytra in the game Minecraft.

## What is ElytrAI?

ElytrAI aims to create an AI where our agent learns how to fly and navigate using Minecraft’s elytra item. The elytra is a rare wing item that is the only single-item source of flight in Minecraft’s survival mode.

This utilizes python and pytorch’s machine learning to keep track of observations in the game system to incentivize the AI to make simple decisions to achieve our group’s predetermined goals.

ElytrAI hopes to teach the agent how to fly long distances, avoid obstacles, and land on targets successfully.
