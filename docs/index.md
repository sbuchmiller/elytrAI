ElytrAI is a project created for the project course CS-175 that aims to create an agent capable of learning to fly an elytra in the game Minecraft.

## What is ElytrAI?

  ElytrAI is our AI project where our agent learns how to fly and navigate using Minecraft’s “elytra” item. The elytra is a rare wing item that is the only single-item source of flight in Minecraft’s survival mode. 
 
  We chose this because we thought that teaching an AI how to navigate would be interesting and challenging. To start, we wanted to see if the AI would be able to fly long distances and land successfully.

  It can be seen here that the ElytrAI distance clearly improves over time.
